100,AnimalCrossing,"Animal Crossing has always been near n dear to my heart, I really enjoyed the original Gamecube release and City Folk as well. However, I was never really able to get into New Horizons. The idea of creating the island to your liking interests but overwhelms me. Partly because I work full time now so I feel like I have no time to grind and wait days for stuff to happen in-game. Anyways, my girlfriend also recently just got into the series and wants to enjoy the new content in NH but we're so far behind that we've only got about 4 neighbors and lots of work to do (months of work I assume). So I come with a few questions and I figured Reddit is the place to go!

1. Can I time travel by switching the date on my Switch? (Will there be any negative affects on our island?)

2. Is there a Meta or best way to progress faster or gain bells/resources? I want to get us caught up as quickly as possible. 

3. My girlfriend is unable to do certain tasks and things unless she's on my account, is there a way to fix this or is it meant to be this way? I'm pretty sure I'm like the ""president"" kind of thing since I started the island.

Now im second guessing whether or not i want the rock garden there or somewhere else and its stressing me out cause i know it will take an insanely long time to make and im scared i wont like it in the end and it makes me stressed to even start. Also stressful since i feel like theres no going back once i terraform too much and i feel like i need to prepare more for how long it will take. If i get deep into it and dont like something it will have been a waste of time thats tough to make normal again

Obviously a rock garden is not something nintendo planned for us to make but i felt the same way while i terraformed a land bridge. Stressed to start because i knew i wouldn‚Äôt be able to make things normal again once i started and worried that i would spend all the time working just to not like it and have it ruin what i used to like. Anyone else find themselves with this mindset?

My island feels like a lot of halfway done ambitious projects that are just floating around my mind cause of this mindset but i just get too stressed to start making big changes",Does how long terraforming stress anyone else out?

302,AnimalCrossing,"Hi y‚Äôall! Like many people, I experience frame rate drops when I walk around my island.  I've read a lot about it but no one seems to understand what really causes it. 

So I thought we could share here what areas are lagging on our respective islands! 
I‚Äôve read that flowers, trees, and water areas are most likely to cause frame drops. 

Things I‚Äôve noticed:
- Turning off my switch (instead of putting it in sleep mode) when I‚Äôm not playin it kinda helps a little. 
-The game runs better at night. 
-It‚Äôs worse on rainy days.
-I took a look at some ¬´¬†off camera¬†¬ª videos to see what‚Äôs rendered off screen and it seems that only Houses, Bridges/Inclines and characters are. Everything else disappears. 

Rules: 
-Describe what is displayed on the screen in the problematic area (if it‚Äôs mostly flowers, trees, items, patterns‚Ä¶), and what is likely to be rendered in the background too (even if you don‚Äôt see it on screen). 
- If you make any change by removing some stuff , let us know if the game seems to run better after that! 
- No messages that are just you complaining about it, it won‚Äôt help. 

‚Äî‚Äî

My experience: 
I gotta be honest I‚Äôm in complete confusion. The most problematic area on my island is on the second tier and displays quite a few panels that are lined up along the cliff, one bridge and 2 inclines. There are a very few trees. Fences on both sides. No flowers. Just a few items. Road patterns as path. 
Off screen, in front of all of that there‚Äôs a river and in the background there‚Äôs Nooks Cranny. 

Things I‚Äôve tried:
Removed half of the panels. Did not help. 
Removed items. Nothing. 
Removed fences. Did nothing. 
Reduce the size of the river. Didn‚Äôt notice any change. 
Removed Nooks Cranny from the area. Did not help. 
I even close and reopen the game for each test. 

That just doesn‚Äôt make any sense cause I have a very similar area (with the Able Sisters) with panels, roads, trees‚Ä¶(I mean very similar!), that is on the first tier, with no river nearby and it‚Äôs not laggy at all.

304,AnimalCrossing,"I've been spending a lot of time on the subreddit lately and I see similar questions pop up a lot so i wanna write a post about things you might be confused about or should know about the update.

There might be some spoilers in here so stop reading if you don't want those.

First of all Harvey's island:
The shops refresh weekly, not daily
One exception is Redd, he gets new artworks whenever you buy one

Happy home Paradise:
After you played a bit of the DLC you will get the option to order any item you can use in the vacation homes from wardell which is great for cataloging.
Also useful are the vines and the glowing moss on the HHP island which can be pucked and will slowly regrow so it's basically an infinite reliable source. 
Also there will be an additional message in a bottle on the shore every day which can contain ruined, vine and moss diys. 

Farming:
The easiest way to get all mew crops is to build Leif's shop on Harvey's island first and buy the starts from there. Of course you can also get the crops from other people but please don't pay high prices, they are not worth higher prices since they are so easy to multiply

Kapp'n:
If what I've read on posts is right then these might be useful information:
Time doesn't pass on Kapp'n islands so you can use them to get fish from other timezones, also you can catch fish and insects from the seasons. 
Apparently ertain islands like cherry blossom Islands are only available if the season they belong in has already passed since your character/island was created

Gyroids:
If you have a rainy day you should dig up all spots on your island the next day since you should be able to find 2 fully grown gyroids. Kapp'n islands wjere it rains will also have extra spots with fully grown gyroids. If you didn't get the color of a gyroid you wanted you can customize them on workbenches

Cooking:
If you give something cooked to a resident on your island they will place it in theor homes. They do not eat it. 
You can get fish recipes by catching certain fish like sea bass, red snapper, dab, blue marlin and probably a lot more. 

Brewster's Caf√©:
Your relationship with brewster will grow for drinking coffee each day. Only the first coffee a day counts. He will give you recipes and items and give you new options on how you drink your coffee. The rewards I know about are a diy recipe for the brewster cookies, a bad of coffee beans (an item, it's not a crop for farms) and a brewster gyroid. The interactions include waiting for your coffee to cool, ordering take away coffee and adding pigeon milk to your coffee.

Other:
Please be careful with decorating your island with vines and glowing moss. Visitors can steal your glowing moss without any tools (I'm not sure about vines) so if you're worried about that, be careful who visits your island. 

I hope this was interesting for some people

351,AnimalCrossing,"this is a repost because my other post was removed for it being a question 

this list goes least to greatest and includes the most money making strats. 

PUMPKINS: pumpkins sell for 350 bells (420 with bell boom) and when watered in both stages you will get 1050 (1260 with BB). pumpkins make easy money and are easy to get which is perfect for the early game but take time if you want to get as much as you can get out of your farms. 

&amp;#x200B;

GOLD ROSES: gold roses make 1000 (1200 with BB) already making only 50 less than 3 pumpkins and require 0 watering of the golden flowers, but if you have 10 gold flowers you can craft a gold rose wreath you can sell that for 20k (24k with BB) doubling your profits if you sold the 10 roses alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

AB&amp;PD: the AB%PD is unlocked when you have finished your home and appears in the happy home main building,  the machine inside will convert Poki to Bells at a variable rate. Each day, a new conversion rate is set. Much like Turnips, this offers players another avenue for speculation to maximize revenue. Converting Poki on the right day can earn you more Bells, this only happens after 24 or more homes. this adds up fast as you can keep remodeling the same home over and over for fast poki gains",My favorite bell making methods (not a question mods)

423,AnimalCrossing,"When news came of the release for the Happy Home Paradise DLC for Animal Crossing New Horizon's, I knew it was a good time to get back into the series and lose many, many hours to this wonderful game. 

While I've been enjoying everyday in game as much as possible, something interesting has happened along the way. When it came time to change my town tune, I was at a loss as to what to do. Do I scour YouTube for an established song to make my island my own? I decided no to that, and to instead make my own. Well, what should have taken me a few minutes, turned into several hours of making several town tunes. This got me thinking of doing something a little different, a little pointless, but a lot of fun! 

I've decided I'm going to make a micro album of original compositions that can be made in game.
I'm wanting to have about 6 to 10 tracks on the album and for all of them to not only be as good as I can make them, but for them to be as unique from each other as possible. This will definitely be a challenge, but that just makes it all the more fun! 

For those who have played Animal Crossing know, the town tune creator is not only very limited, but also very basic. Songs are only a few seconds in length. You're limited to a scale of 13 notes(no sharps and flats), 16 notes in the staff total, and no real control over tempo. Basically, it's somewhat of a nightmare to compose music on! 

With all that being said, I'm very much looking forward to the challenge. I'd like to have this done before the year is up, but you just never know. I've posted 2 videos on YouTube of the songs I think will be on said micro album(linked in the comments below). 

Give me some feedback! Hope you all have a wonderful day üôÇ",A fun Animal Crossing project I'm working on!

532,AnimalCrossing,"Hi guys!

I searched for an answer to this, but I didn't find anything.  Probably because I am not really sure how to best describe it, so here goes...

I've got the Co-Op trailers all set up on Harv's Island and I have been noticing that none of the various sellers ever change their inventories.  Sahara for example is still selling the exact same rugs and mats she was listing the day she got set up!  It has been 2 weeks now and no changes.  (Been wanting to buy some more Persian Rugs, but none for sale so far and no changes being made to rugs for sale!)

Same goes for Lief and Redd.  Only time I saw any minor changes to the item lists was when I purchased an item from one of these guys, like Redd.  Is that the only way to get them to update their offerings?  What if you are not interested in anything they currently list for sale?    Redd for example, if you already have all the paintings he is selling in your Museum.  Currently the case for me.

If anyone knows what is going on here, or what I am doing wrong, please enlighten me!  I was looking forward to having a wider selection of items from each of these sellers when they had their own trailers on Harv's Island, but so far this is proving more limiting than when they just popped up on my own island.  At least then they are selling a different collection of goods each time they visit.

Also, for some weird reason, I think that villagers tend to respect normal paths more (I might be wrong about this, just an impression!).

But so far, not only have I not found anymore gold nuggets, but I also haven't found any money rocks at all. I thought every mystery island had at least one money rock. According to the video, if you have bad money fortune, the money rocks are replaced by regular ones. But I didn't get a bad fortune, I got a good one. And if I did get a bad fortune, I wouldn't have gotten a gold nugget since the chances are 0% at that point. So what's going on?

671,AnimalCrossing,"this least goes least to greatest and includes the most money making strats. 

PUMPKINS: pumpkins sell for 350 bells (420 with bell boom) and when watered in both stages you will get 1050 (1260 with BB). pumpkins make easy money and are easy to get which is perfect for the early game but take time if you want to get as much as you can get out of your farms. 

&amp;#x200B;

GOLD ROSES: gold roses make 1000 (1200 with BB) already making only 50 less than 3 pumpkins and require 0 watering of the golden flowers, but if you have 10 gold flowers you can craft a gold rose wreath you can sell that for 20k (24k with BB) doubling your profits if you sold the 10 roses alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

AB&amp;PD: the AB%PD is unlocked when you have finished your home and appears in the happy home main building,  the machine inside will conver tPoki to Bells at a variable rate. Each day, a new conversion rate is set. Much like Turnips, this offers players another avenue for speculation to maximize revenue. Converting Poki on the right day can earn you more Bells, this only happens after 24 or more homes. this adds up fast as you can keep remodeling the same home over and over for fat poki",Top 3 best bell making methods for ACNH!

I can utilize the happy home DLC, and have the ""I want to go to work"" option, but she does not. Do we have to get to a certain point on the main player for hers to have this option? Is there something missing? Any suggestions, things to try, etc. thank you kindly &lt;3","Happy home DLC - second player unable to utilize DLC, DLC is purchased"

1074,AnimalCrossing,"okay so I recently picked animal crossing back up after the new update and have been working really hard on my island and have just had trouble reaching that 5 star island status‚Ä¶ today I logged on and noticed a lily of the valley on my island. I GOT SO EXCITED thinking that I finally reached 5 star island status?!?! WRONG. I checked with isabelle and she said i‚Äôm still a 4 star island. Has this happened to anyone else before?? Does this mean i‚Äôm close to getting a 5 star rating?? i‚Äôm so confused and disheartened. Let me know, thanks!",Lily of the Valley on a 4 star island?

1086,AnimalCrossing,"I've customized at least 15 vacation homes and even got the prompt to tell Niko about all my DIY recipes. I unlocked this at 2AM however and I thought that maybe that's why it didn't unlock when I was on yesterday because it technically hadn't been a day since talking to Niko. However logging on today I still don't have the prompt despite unlocking the ability to have roommates and soundscapes. The only thing I can still think of is that on the day I was supposed to unlock the pillars and counters DIY recipes I went to work from Harv's island.

Is anybody else having this issue? I'm going to try to design the restaurant (I was waiting for counters to do this) and give my school a name since those are the only things I've yet to do facility wise.",I didn't get the DIY recipe for pillars and counters
