-The game runs better at night.

I gotta be honest I‚Äôm in complete confusion.

Removed half of the panels. Did not help. 
Removed items. Nothing. 
Removed fences. Did nothing. 
Reduce the size of the river. Didn‚Äôt notice any change. 
Removed Nooks Cranny from the area. Did not help.

297,AnimalCrossing,"I've been spending a lot of time on the subreddit lately and I see similar questions pop up a lot so i wanna write a post about things you might be confused about or should know about the update.

There might be some spoilers in here so stop reading if you don't want those.

First of all Harvey's island:
The shops refresh weekly, not daily
One exception is Redd, he gets new artworks whenever you buy one

Happy home Paradise:
After you played a bit of the DLC you will get the option to order any item you can use in the vacation homes from wardell which is great for cataloging.
Also useful are the vines and the glowing moss on the HHP island which can be pucked and will slowly regrow so it's basically an infinite reliable source. 
Also there will be an additional message in a bottle on the shore every day which can contain ruined, vine and moss diys. 

Farming:
The easiest way to get all mew crops is to build Leif's shop on Harvey's island first and buy the starts from there. Of course you can also get the crops from other people but please don't pay high prices, they are not worth higher prices since they are so easy to multiply

Kapp'n:
If what I've read on posts is right then these might be useful information:
Time doesn't pass on Kapp'n islands so you can use them to get fish from other timezones, also you can catch fish and insects from the seasons. 
Apparently ertain islands like cherry blossom Islands are only available if the season they belong in has already passed since your character/island was created

Gyroids:
If you have a rainy day you should dig up all spots on your island the next day since you should be able to find 2 fully grown gyroids. Kapp'n islands wjere it rains will also have extra spots with fully grown gyroids. If you didn't get the color of a gyroid you wanted you can customize them on workbenches

Cooking:
If you give something cooked to a resident on your island they will place it in theor homes. They do not eat it. 
You can get fish recipes by catching certain fish like sea bass, red snapper, dab, blue marlin and probably a lot more. 

Brewster's Caf√©:
Your relationship with brewster will grow for drinking coffee each day. Only the first coffee a day counts. He will give you recipes and items and give you new options on how you drink your coffee. The rewards I know about are a diy recipe for the brewster cookies, a bad of coffee beans (an item, it's not a crop for farms) and a brewster gyroid. The interactions include waiting for your coffee to cool, ordering take away coffee and adding pigeon milk to your coffee.

Other:
Please be careful with decorating your island with vines and glowing moss. Visitors can steal your glowing moss without any tools (I'm not sure about vines) so if you're worried about that, be careful who visits your island. 

I hope this was interesting for some people

&amp;#x200B;

GOLD ROSES: gold roses make 1000 (1200 with BB) already making only 50 less than 3 pumpkins and require 0 watering of the golden flowers, but if you have 10 gold flowers you can craft a gold rose wreath you can sell that for 20k (24k with BB) doubling your profits if you sold the 10 roses alone.

AB&amp;PD: the AB%PD is unlocked when you have finished your home and appears in the happy home main building,  the machine inside will convert Poki to Bells at a variable rate. Each day, a new conversion rate is set. Much like Turnips, this offers players another avenue for speculation to maximize revenue.

Once I updated to 2.0 and upgraded Harv's island the first thing I did was unlock Redd because I was sick of waiting, I have now purchased 2 genuine pieces of artwork from him, being the Ancient Statue (I think that's its name) and the Wild Painting Left Half, I double checked multiple sources to confirm they were real pieces of artwork before buying them both. I have attempted multiple times to donate these to blathers (even attempting it once with only these items in my pockets) and he doesn't even acknowledge they're in my inventory, I don't even have the ""I found a painting!"" option available, am I royally screwed now? Is my museum just stuck because now Redd will never visit my island, do I HAVE to get the common painting or whatever its called to push Blathers forward? I'm so annoyed I can't just find talk to Blathers about upgrading instead of having to jump through all these loops and utilising features I don't care about for 1 feature I do care about...

While I've been enjoying everyday in game as much as possible, something interesting has happened along the way. When it came time to change my town tune, I was at a loss as to what to do. Do I scour YouTube for an established song to make my island my own? I decided no to that, and to instead make my own. Well, what should have taken me a few minutes, turned into several hours of making several town tunes. This got me thinking of doing something a little different, a little pointless, but a lot of fun! 

I've decided I'm going to make a micro album of original compositions that can be made in game.
I'm wanting to have about 6 to 10 tracks on the album and for all of them to not only be as good as I can make them, but for them to be as unique from each other as possible. This will definitely be a challenge, but that just makes it all the more fun! 

For those who have played Animal Crossing know, the town tune creator is not only very limited, but also very basic. Songs are only a few seconds in length. You're limited to a scale of 13 notes(no sharps and flats), 16 notes in the staff total, and no real control over tempo. Basically, it's somewhat of a nightmare to compose music on! 

With all that being said, I'm very much looking forward to the challenge. I'd like to have this done before the year is up, but you just never know. I've posted 2 videos on YouTube of the songs I think will be on said micro album(linked in the comments below).

516,AnimalCrossing,"Hi guys!

I searched for an answer to this, but I didn't find anything.  Probably because I am not really sure how to best describe it, so here goes...

I've got the Co-Op trailers all set up on Harv's Island and I have been noticing that none of the various sellers ever change their inventories.  Sahara for example is still selling the exact same rugs and mats she was listing the day she got set up!  It has been 2 weeks now and no changes.  (Been wanting to buy some more Persian Rugs, but none for sale so far and no changes being made to rugs for sale!)

Same goes for Lief and Redd.  Only time I saw any minor changes to the item lists was when I purchased an item from one of these guys, like Redd.  Is that the only way to get them to update their offerings?  What if you are not interested in anything they currently list for sale?    Redd for example, if you already have all the paintings he is selling in your Museum.  Currently the case for me.

If anyone knows what is going on here, or what I am doing wrong, please enlighten me!  I was looking forward to having a wider selection of items from each of these sellers when they had their own trailers on Harv's Island, but so far this is proving more limiting than when they just popped up on my own island.  At least then they are selling a different collection of goods each time they visit.

Thanks in advance!",Trailer Park/Harv's Island Inventories Rarely Change! ??? What am I missing?,1,"Trailer Park/Harv's Island Inventories Rarely Change! ??? What am I missing? Hi guys!

There are sooooo many conversations I have with random Sims, many of them who don't live in Henford-on-Bagley, where just trying to have a Deep Conversation or Get to Know or many of the usual conversation subjects just give me the same popups about how I should talk to the people in Henford and offer to be their errand person.

I suppose I should have expected that with my Sim who was living there.

In the Sims 4 there is a vibe that people want to feel represented in the game. whether it is ethnicity, culture, sexual orientation or gender expression. That sentiment somehow wasn't really strong in The Sims 2 (or even 3 if I recall correctly). So I would want to dive into whether Sims 2 properly represents culture in any of the expansions. Sims 3 seems pretty straight forward with World Adventures.

Most of the foreign culture would be found in Bon Voyage since they are based on international locations. Most of the time they don't claim to represent any culture, just borrow elements of it.

* Three Lakes: Definitely look North American for sure. I do suspect some elements of Scandinavian in it (Sauna and Swedish Massage)
* Takemizu Village: They play hard and fast rule in this because they are influenced by both Japanese (Zen Garden, Tea set, kimonos, the Tori Gate) and Chinese cultures (Tai Chi, Mahjong) and called it ""Far East""
* Twikii Island: Hula from Hawaiian, I'm not sure where the fire dance comes from, as well as the ancient ruins (Aztec/Maya civilization?)

They also definitely borrowed some culture in their builds and clothing. There is Korean hanbok from base game, Moroccan style builds, Mediterranean etc.

does anyone have any insight, or any experience with this specific bug?","['jobs', 'glitching', 'out?', 'this', 'pertains', 'to', 'the', 'sims', '4.', 'i', 'did', 'some', 'general', 'googling', 'about', 'this', 'a', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'when', 'the', 'problem', 'first', 'arose,', 'and', 'i', ""didn't"", 'really', 'find', 'anything', 'super', 'definitive', 'besides', 'instructions', 'to', 'just', '""reinstall.""', 'wondering', 'if', 'anyone', 'else', 'is', 'having', 'this', 'specific', 'problem.', 'after', 'a', 'period', 'of', 'not', 'playing', 'for', 'a', 'few', 'months,', 'across', 'all', 'my', 'saves', ""i've"", 'been', 'having', 'this', 'trouble', 'where,', 'after', 'my', 'sims', 'are', 'done', 'their', 'shifts', 'at', 'their', 'respective', 'jobs,', 'when', 'they', 'come', 'home', 'they', ""don't"", 'really', '""come', 'home.""', 'their', 'icon', 'is', 'still', 'grayed', 'out', 'like', ""they're"", 'at', 'work,', 'and', 'i', 'can', 'still', 'interact', 'with', 'the', 'work-only', 'commands', '(""work', 'hard,""', '""take', 'it', 'easy,""', 'etc.),', 'but', 'they', 'stand', 'at', 'the', 'edge', 'of', 'the', 'lot', 'like', ""they're"", 'done', 'for', 'the', 'day.', 'this', 'has', 'been', 'happening', 'for', 'both', 'the', 'full-', 'and', 'part-time', 'jobs.', 'the', 'only', 'thing', 'that', 'sends', 'them', '""home""', 'is', 'quitting', 'their', 'job.', 'which', 'is', 'insanely', 'frustrating,', 'considering', 'this', 'is', 'conveniently', 'happening', 'to', 'sims', 'who', 'i', 'actually', 'want', 'to', 'play', 'through', 'a', 'career.', 'this', 'does', 'not', 'affect', 'any', 'other', 'sims', 'on', 'the', 'lot', 'who', ""aren't"", 'at', 'work.', 'i', 'use', 'three', 'script', 'mods', '(mccc', 'command', 'center,', 'cleaner;', 'meaningful', 'stories;', 'and', 'passionate', 'romance)', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'custom', 'content.', 'i', 'own', 'cottage', 'living,', 'discover', 'university,', 'seasons,', 'cats', '&', 'dogs,', 'city', 'living', 'and', 'get', 'together,', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'parenthood', 'and', 'vampires.', 'we', 'also', 'own', 'nifty', 'knitting,', 'bowling', 'night,', 'and', 'movie', 'hangout.', 'notably,', 'we', 'only', 'recently', 'acquired', 'cottage', 'living,', 'and', 'this', 'started', 'happening', 'before', 'we', 'owned', 'it.', 'does', 'anyone', 'have', 'any', 'insight,', 'or', 'any', 'experience', 'with', 'this', 'specific', 'bug?']",1526,260

So... what exactly is duplicato, you might ask?

Duplicato creates a visibly and skill-wise identical copy of your sim. They will be given a kind of similar name to your current sim (for instance, I wound up with an initial character named Nadia, and her clone was named Alyssa.) Unlike the get to work cloning process, this will not flip alignments (good clones will not become evil from my experimentation). You can command this clone to cook, clean, or fight somebody, and in a few hours, they will poof themselves back into nonexistence.

But not always. 

Here are some ways I found to mess that up.

1. Create a complex clone love triangle. I had a jealous sim that made a clone then another sim made out with that clone. The clone did not go away. The clone kept showing up at festivals or whatever until I finally befriended and edited the clone and made it a part of another household, with a different outfit, missing tattoos, new scars, and a new personality. 
2. Edit the clone in any way. The moment you go into create a sim, the clone is now a permanent part of the game world and will not disappear. In some cases, this can be nice. One of my sims died and I couldn't get them to come back from being a ghost (dedeathify and ambrosia wouldn't work) so I just gave up, deleted the sim, and started a new life as their clone.
3. Inviting them to a social event. For example, putting them in a club, or calling them to join a party (even as a caterer). This makes the sim real and permanent, and they won't disappear.
4. Adding them to your household via cheats or via conversation. This will obviously make them a permanent part of the household.
5. If a sim you do not control casts duplicato, it seems as if the associated clone just exists now. I had a club where one of the positive activities was spellcasting, and a NPC sim cast duplicato, creating a permanent clone that just appeared at festivals some times. 

So what does a clone do?

They have all the skills and magic levels of the original sim, but none of the relationships, money, or inventory. My sim that died had the ancient bloodline trait. When I took control of her disowned clone, she also had ancient bloodline, and her magic skills were where they were when I created the clone.

They have traits and university degrees of the original sim. This means that you can start a job at career level 7 as if you had a degree, even though the clone does not have a degree itself.

If you have a full household of 8 sims, you invite over 8 more, and you attempt to get all of the above to cast duplicato, you can almost definitely break the game. 

Clones register as siblings of the caster. This means that you can have a really messed up family tree if you create enough permanent clones of a character. Two parents can give birth to one baby, and when that baby reaches teenage to adulthood, they can perform magical mitosis and turn into infinite versions of themselves (note that you need to wait a while between duplicato uses).

My personal recommendation:

Some people try to create the ""super sim"", with perfect skills and all the traits. It takes forever. If you want a whole household of these, you can have the super sim mentor all of them, or you can just have the super sim become a spellcaster long enough to get far enough in the untamed magic tree to create other sims. Add them to the household and edit them to be whatever name, appearance, age, and personality you want, and you have an entire household.

Clones act as save states for sims too, if you, like me, are prone to having sims die in stupid ways. They just walk around and exist, and if your sim dies, you can always just possess the clone and make them the new protagonist of whatever messed up story you're creating. 

Or you can make your clone cook, clean, beat the crap out of your neighbors, and then disappear.

1214,thesims,"Hi!

We've had all our share of frustration in TS4 with people just entering our Sims' residence and just. Refusing. To. Leave. But a few days ago I had someone that I could not get rid of no matter what I tried, to the point where I cheated to give myself enough money to move to a house.

I was living in an apartment from the City Living town as a aspiring pro gamer, and if that makes any difference, I even had the ""Private dwelling"" trait on it. 

Everything was cool until one day, this random Sim just comes in my apartment. He starts using my computer, he starts eating my food, he walks on me when I'm in the bathroom, he SLEEPS IN MY FREAKING BED, and his very presence made my sleep and time at work super long because he was an active Sim in my lot so I could not get the uber speed. I was also pissed because my Sim is a loner and his presence was making her tense, when he wasn't getting her embarrassed from entering in the bathroom when she was taking a bath.

The option to ""Send home"" never showed up in the menu (so random how it's not always there but it always shows up eventually, not for THIS GUY though). 

I also never had the ""Ask to leave"" dialogue option.

I started using mean interaction towards him, including ""Go away"", I even fought him and won, but he still stayed.

He was there for several days and never had the ""Oopsie, gotta leave, it's late"" prompt.

He eventually walked out of my apartment (either autonomously or because I lured him by moving there as I talked to him, can't remember) so I immediately locked my door to everyone but my Sim and disabled solicitors, friends, visitors, EVERYTHING, but that motherF-er just WALTZED BACK IN REGARDLESS and started using my stuff as though he lived there. HELLO. YOU DON'T LEAVE HERE. GET OUT.

I looked online for ways to get rid of him, through the console or otherwise, but no luck. At my wit's ends, I used the motherlode cheat (which pissed me off because I didn't want to money cheat in that game) and moved out to a house in Sulani.

1230,thesims,"I noticed something that's very interesting to me in the franchise's lore. 

So starting with The Sims 1, there were alien abductions that were treated with the sims crying and then treating the abducted sim like normal when they come back, as if they know exactly what the abductions entail. Then the babies with an alien skintone are treated like normal babies.

In The Sims 2 there is no in-game mechanics that make the aliens any different than regular sims but in the game's lore it's very prominent that there's a lot of tensions between the aliens and the people. The abductions are known about, with how your friends can greet you with ""hey, have you been abducted by aliens?"" on the phone and have wants/fears of it happening. The abducted sims are horrified of what this means and there's a lot of scientists studying the subject, meaning they don't know as much about aliens yet.

In TS3 there isn't a single alien living on Earth but they do come by to inspect it. The sims don't treat them any different (unless there was some moodlet I don't remember). The aliens can become test subject and can't get plastic surgery, so we can say that the sims don't know a lot about them. The effects of abduction are not known either, since pregnant males think it's abnormal weight gain until they give birth.

Then in The Sims 4 aliens need to put on human disguises and wipe the memories of sims who see them in their alien form. The sims who do then have a crisis about aliens actually being real.

It's okay, it has happened other times, no biggie, I asked to restart the visit, same thing happened, asked again, cat got off again, and again, and again and I lost count of how many times it happened.
I debugged her, it happened again, I debugged the cat, it happened again, I debugged the table.
Now the cat is on the table, she is standing beside it with her arms open  not doing anything, debugging does not work anymore. It is 14:30 simtime, she accomplished nothing, customers are lining up and getting angry, clinic's reputation is going down.
And I can't even let her go home, because she is unresponsive to every command.

Please, go on and tell me again how complaining about the poor service this game is offering to paying costumers is just overreacting to be dramatic.
 Honestly, I am never going to pay for the sims, ever again. If I happen to gave a new pc I would just crack the hell out of it, but EA will never see my money again","['for', 'once', 'i', 'was', 'enjoying', 'the', 'sims', '4', 'the', 'game', 'was', 'going', 'smoothly', 'enough,', 'my', 'sim', 'runs', 'a', 'vet', 'clinic', 'and', 'she', 'is', 'a', 'single', 'mom.', 'my', 'plan', 'was', 'to', 'let', 'her', 'work', 'on', 'the', 'clinic', 'all', 'morning', 'and', 'send', 'her', 'back', 'home', 'when', 'the', 'child', 'returns', 'from', 'school.', 'easy', 'right?', 'apparently', 'not.', 'she', 'arrived', 'at', 'the', 'clinic', 'at', 'around', '9', 'am', 'sim', 'time,', 'first', 'client', 'arrived,', 'she', 'began', 'visiting', 'the', 'cat,', 'the', 'cat', 'would', 'jump', 'on', 'the', 'table,', 'then', 'when', 'she', 'is', 'about', 'to', 'visit', 'him', 'the', 'table', 'would', 'slide', 'down', 'and', 'the', 'cat', 'would', 'walk', 'away.', ""it's"", 'okay,', 'it', 'has', 'happened', 'other', 'times,', 'no', 'biggie,', 'i', 'asked', 'to', 'restart', 'the', 'visit,', 'same', 'thing', 'happened,', 'asked', 'again,', 'cat', 'got', 'off', 'again,', 'and', 'again,', 'and', 'again', 'and', 'i', 'lost', 'count', 'of', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'it', 'happened.', 'i', 'debugged', 'her,', 'it', 'happened', 'again,', 'i', 'debugged', 'the', 'cat,', 'it', 'happened', 'again,', 'i', 'debugged', 'the', 'table.', 'now', 'the', 'cat', 'is', 'on', 'the', 'table,', 'she', 'is', 'standing', 'beside', 'it', 'with', 'her', 'arms', 'open', 'not', 'doing', 'anything,', 'debugging', 'does', 'not', 'work', 'anymore.', 'it', 'is', '14:30', 'simtime,', 'she', 'accomplished', 'nothing,', 'customers', 'are', 'lining', 'up', 'and', 'getting', 'angry,', ""clinic's"", 'reputation', 'is', 'going', 'down.', 'and', 'i', ""can't"", 'even', 'let', 'her', 'go', 'home,', 'because', 'she', 'is', 'unresponsive', 'to', 'every', 'command.', 'please,', 'go', 'on', 'and', 'tell', 'me', 'again', 'how', 'complaining', 'about', 'the', 'poor', 'service', 'this', 'game', 'is', 'offering', 'to', 'paying', 'costumers', 'is', 'just', 'overreacting', 'to', 'be', 'dramatic.', 'honestly,', 'i', 'am', 'never', 'going', 'to', 'pay', 'for', 'the', 'sims,', 'ever', 'again.', 'if', 'i', 'happen', 'to', 'gave', 'a', 'new', 'pc', 'i', 'would', 'just', 'crack', 'the', 'hell', 'out', 'of', 'it,', 'but', 'ea', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'my', 'money', 'again']",1439,274

I remember when The Sims 2 came out, I got heavy into CC and it started to break my game. I lost many save files back then. 

I didn't care for The Sims 3 but I'm in full speed ahead with The Sims 4 and I am so far separated from the horror of CC in The Sims 2 that I cannot fathom the obsession with mods and CC today.

What I'm trying to say is...

Please, someone:

1) Explain the wonderful world of mods and CC 

2) Is it just as broken as it was back then? (I've seen streamers lose their whole games because of CC in the past few years. One streamer can't play The Sims 4 University at all )

But this happens again, and again, and (you guessed it again). I restart my computer, it still doesn't fix the in-game toggle that refuses to be turned on.

This has been going on for a few days so I contact EA help. I explain the issue and how it's something in game that has gone wrong as I only use very common and popular mods (SoL, MCCC, UI cheats). I am then told to just ""not use mods"". I am fuming at the impertinence of this answer and after explaining that it isn't due to the mods and is due to the game and being told once again to just not use mods, I passive aggressively tell the employee to have a nice day and I leave the chat.

That being said, I have long enjoyed the music in Sims games, even if they don't have 'understandable' lyrics. Anyway, aside from the obvious songs 
-- Spooky station from Sims 4, Industrial station from the console versions of Sims 2, Central Station music from Urbz, Darkwave station in Sims 3 -- 
it's been difficult finding songs that would be appropriate or considered 'goth'.

I've been looking into other genres within the games, such as pop, electronica/techno, etc., and while I have found some really good ones that do fit, most obviously don't. I do want to upload this simlish goth playlist somewhere, as I am comprising it of mp3 files, but even though I have over 40 songs now, it still doesn't feel complete.

I think any of the games, from spin-offs to different versions of one game in the franchise or another, would have a lot of potential. They're at least worth combing the files for. I just don't have all the games to effectively do such a thing.

If anyone has any suggestions or links to blogs, YouTube, etc. involving any game in the series, old or new, please feel free to give them.

1535,thesims,"I don't have every DLC pack but I have a few, so here's all the aspirations from all the DLC I have, divided into categories of usefulness.

**Absolutely worth the effort**

Bodybuilder: Fast, easy accomplishments that let your sim just hover around old age for like another entire generation. Very strong.

Bestselling author: This one lets you cheat death as many times as you like. Quite good, quite powerful.

Super parent: If you already have a bunch of kids living in a house, why not turn their parent into superman? Great to have an incredibly skilled old fart.

Big Happy family: That but now the kids gain skills faster to give to their parent faster. Especially good if the parent is immortal, like they're a ghost or a vampire or something.

Master chef: You can just make food for later, leave it on the counter, and eat it whenever. It never goes bad. This is fantastic.

Master Mixologist: There are some things you can make that greatly increase skill gain, which is pretty good. Combine it with master chef and you can make a ton of these and leave them out and they won't go bad.

Renaissance Sim: Better for legacy playthroughs, but it can be good to be able to send your knowledge forward a few generations.

Computer Whiz: Research binge is the main ""worth it"" thing, if you want to just raise a lot of skills and don't care what order.

Beach Life: Tense is an annoying emotion that prevents a lot of productive actions and now you just never get it again. This aspiration is really easy to get too.

Freelance botanist: For some reason it makes sims fireproof. Not sure why, but that is what it does. They can't die in fires. Nobody really expects a sim to die in a fire but sometimes it happens, unless they get really into botany.

Eco innovator: You control a person's level of fame or infamy. Very strong, very funny.

Joke star: Death by laughter is a thing in the sims 4. I'll let that speak for itself.

Grilled Cheese: More for the experience than the results, but being able to spontaneously create a grilled cheese sandwich with one's will is hilarious. With master chef, you can create a house full of grilled cheese that will never expire. Truly the best possible outcome.

**Worth it if you're already using the thing it's about**

Friend of the animals: Admittedly, if ageing is off, this is worthless, because your pet will be perfectly trained by the time you're finished anyways, but if ageing is on, it's nice because animals don't live as long so you might as well be able to train up the next one faster.

Painter extraordinaire: You're already max level in painting more than likely when this is done, but you might as well get perfect emotional paintings every time. More money from an already decently fast and financially viable activity.

Super parent: Friend of the animals but for kids. Only good if you plan on having more after the first set is finished.

Serial Romantic: If you're seducing that many sims, this is an absolute game changer. Now you can woohoo with another one, get caught, and nobody cares.

Soulmate: These interactions provide nice happy moodlets, and if you're already in the market for some monogamy, might as well make it work for you. This might pair with Serial Romantic to allow for multiple spouses but I'm not sure.

Country Caretaker: Buffs a lot of stuff specific to farming in Henford-On-Bagley, but if you're doing that, this is awesome.

The curator: If you're gathering a bunch of crap anyways, might as well sell it for more. Pairs very well with the scientist career.

Friend of the world: Nice way to maintain a big list of friends, otherwise not that important.

Galactic Privateer: Kleptomania with no consequences can be funny.

Calming aura: It's mostly for the visuals but the visuals are fun.

Self-Care specialist: You're already doing this, might as well get a raise.

**If you have it, you no longer need it.**

Survival Instinct: To do this, you've basically finished Mt. Korembi. There's no reason to get this anymore.

Master actor/actress: The stuff you have to do to get this make this worthless. You've already gotten gold in several different gigs and won an award.

Fabulously wealthy: Now you... get more money. Since you didn't have money before.

Mansion Baron: Now you can... build a bigger house. Because you didn't have a big house before.

Nerd Brain: You can fix everything pretty quickly with even very low handiness

Spellcraft and Sorcery: At this point, you can probably just discharge magic buildup.

World Famous Celebrity: The real fun part here is laying down a star. Aside from that, it's not altogether that necessary. When you're really famous, your fame goes up from literally standing around in public.

Leader of the pack: Your club is probably already quite good by this point.

Party animal: You've already thrown really good parties by this point.

Good Vampire: first off it's way less interesting than playing an evil vampire, and second, if you have enough positive relationships, they'll let you drink from them regardless.

**Something else is easier and better than this**

Piper: There are so many ways to influence a sim's mood, this doesn't really matter.

Public enemy: Funny for a second but it's not hard to make a sim feel a negative emotion.

Vampire family: Outclassed by Master Vampire

Academic: A lot of work to get a free source of income. Honestly, the degree is more important than the aspiration.

Mt. Korembi Sightseer: The easier socialization is okay, but cheaper stall food can be done with decent charisma, and it's not that expensive anyways. Only applies to two areas in the entire game.

City Native: Free discounts are faster than the Mt. Korembi one, but there's nothing else there for you.

Purveyor of Potions: There's a selectable spellcasting perk that does exactly what this does.

Angling Ace: There are easier ways to reduce bad moodlets, but this is fine if you want a way to make some money while removing all negative moodlets.

Clear perspective: Beach life does this by default.

**Not really noticeable enough**

Master maker: Crafting isn't that expensive. This makes it somewhat cheaper, but it doesn't matter that much for a sim that's already crazy good at it.

Tormenter: You can already sabotage most things with a handiness skill, so this isn't super significant.

Master Vampire: The commands aren't even that good when you can just hire a maid, or get Bonehilda for free with the right DLC.

Strangerville Mystery: The goodie bags they give you aren't very good. Food and future cubes and sometimes literal dirt. The getting is better than the having.

Hope vs Order: Only applicable in the Star Wars world. The campaign itself matters more than this.",A deep look at how useful every Aspiration is,0,"A deep look at how useful every Aspiration is I don't have every DLC pack but I have a few, so here's all the aspirations from all the DLC I have, divided into categories of usefulness.

I‚Äôve been trading the chickens away because I don‚Äôt want to watch them die, but it almost seems glitched because it gives me the notification every single time I load onto the lot, but grim hasn‚Äôt appeared yet. I‚Äôve tried taking my mods out, restarting the game, and turning aging on and off then restarting the game, but my chickens keep aging.

* You start as a **young adult** \- *with zero money* \- who has just moved to San Myshuno, but you get **the worst possible apartment**  (the one with the balcony and lot's of rats and bugs and plumbing  issues). You are allowed to have furniture, but you have to make the  place look old and disgusting (before starting the challenge you can  build as you wish). You can't have nice appliances.
* You'll choose the **Super Parent** aspiration.
* You are allowed to work only as a barista, or as a fast food/retail employee.
* Then  you meet someone and have a kid. You cannot get married to that person  and you'll have none to minor contact with them. In my game, my kid has a  super absent father.
* You  and your kid have to live under constant stress. You'll feel always  tense, so sometimes you won't be able to perform very important tasks.  Your kid will feel so tense with all the rats and smelly environment  that they won't do their homework. Bad grades, sleep deprivement, barely  enough food. Meanwhile you'll **save all the money you can**, promising yourself it's going to go to your kid's college tuition.

In my game, my kid learned how to cross-stitch and knit and he helps his mom make extra money.

* You have to be promoted on your job and earn raises.

Your kid will not be able to enroll at any college, but *they'll get a slightly better job* (my kid is turning out to love comedy, so he's going to be a comedian). **Their job will depend on their skills and personality** (you have to randomize the traits every time your kid grows up).
* When  your kid becomes an young adult, they'll decide to make things right  and be different from their father. So they will get married, all that  jazz, and have at least one child. **And this child has to go to college**.
* You'll  upgrade the apartment gradually whenever you want and are able to. By  the third generation, when your child is an adult, you can move to a  better apartment. And so on.
* Besides getting to the 10th generation, you objective is to end up in a **penthouse** with one of **the best jobs available**. So you do whatever it takes to improve your family life, your children's education and your pay grade.
* Just one more thing: **you have to completely accomplish every aspiration**. The aspirations are going to be chosen based on your Sims' personalities and those personalities need to be randomized.

#**Introduction for Newcomers**

Every two weeks the challenge will change, We‚Äôll design a different house or interior of a room and we might even sneak a few Create-A-Sims in to break it up a little.

Certain challenges will have a monetary limit, some will be spend as much as you like/can to impress.

We try to make it so everyone can participate in all challenges no matter which Sims game you have and which expansion/stuff packs you have.

If you would like to see some of our past challenges, please check out [THIS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qo2P0G5JdfOxMXutRC3YPI5YFQ4yHSmXOGwuDOAUtSE/edit) link.

#**Bi-Weekly Build Challenge, Week 117: A-Contemporary A-Frame Cabins!* 

The A-frame, in its purest sense, is a house shaped like an equilateral triangle. Its distinctive peak is formed by rafters or trusses that are joined at the top and bolted to plates or floor joists down below. Occasionally short on space, A frames are forever rooted in boundless ingenuity. They are highly adaptable structures that allow for boundless creative collaboration between architects, designers and the residents themselves. Really, the roof‚Äôs the limit. And that‚Äôs it: A-frames meet the earth on rubble or cinderblock walls, concrete or wood columns, but their essential nature is to float slightly above their environment, a viewing platform for an expanse of nature. 


Residential &amp; vacation properties ONLY. Must be fully functional. (TIP: Consider using cheats to unlock debug/hidden items and to place objects more freely!)

***NOTE: Challenges are open for TWO weeks!***

1724,thesims,"Hi everyone, Carl's Sim Guides here. I've been working on a mod to address what I see as a problem in Sims 4: its difficulty. No, a Sims game shouldn't be hard, but past games were a bit more tough to manage. Especially time and relationships. It doesn't yet add tons of depth, but it will make certain aspects of the game more challenging.

First, **Career Performance** is reduced by a tad, but losses to career performance are increased substantially. It's rare to lose a lot of performance, but skipping a day of work will really set you back. Better off making it a half day. It's just realistic. People get sick and lose their jobs, but at least in the Sims your past performance is measured.

Second, **Emotion.** Many moodlets in the game lack the punch to go through the multitude of happy bonuses that exist. Sometimes, something should actually make your Sim angry or sad and this should slow you down a bit and make relationships difficult. For experienced players, this can be a joke. All negative moodlets with +1-3 are doubled in strength and duration. Those that have long durations, in order to account for the game considering these ""big events"" are tripled duration but if strong enough may only have a couple points added.

Third, **Finances** \- bills are doubled, primarily property taxes. In addition, **incomes are halved** just to make the build catalog a bit more sane on many items. That $675 solar panel will now effectively cost you $1350 so it'll be hard to defeat the game's Eco system right away in a save. Doubling bills and halving finances are not the same thing and not equivalent. You make income all week and therefore can afford the extra bills. Does this scale well with mansions? Well, I don't care much because by the time I'm that rich the game is often over for me.

Finally **Relationships** \- understanding of the relationships system will be needed, as if you spam socials without regard for the conversation tone, mood of yourself and the other Sim, you can dig yourself a hole due to increased losses to relationship gains. In addtion, it will take about 2x as long to build a friendship or romance with another Sim.

Hi everyone, Carl's Sim Guides here. I've been working on a mod to address what I see as a problem in Sims 4: its difficulty. No, a Sims game shouldn't be hard, but past games were a bit more tough to manage. Especially time and relationships. It doesn't yet add tons of depth, but it will make certain aspects of the game more challenging.

First, **Career Performance** is reduced by a tad, but losses to career performance are increased substantially.

Reason: To start off I wanted to just focus on filling up Newcrest with houses but no families. I want to just have builds so the players can add the families they wish or just use newcrest as a way to quickly move to a house without looking for it on the gallery or building it themselves.

Currently: I started in the upper section of newcrest called Bridgeview where there are 5 lots, this is the modern/eco friendly area. On a 20x15 lot by the canal, I have a small 1 bedroom house that is a starter home for a 1 or maybe 2 sims. On the other 20x15 lot, I have a park with yoga mats and a place to eat and public toilets. On a 30x20 lot by the intersection I am currently building a 2 bedroom 2-storey modern house, with garage, pool, solar panels, a very expensive eco house. 

Future plans: on the section I am currently building I have 2 lots left, I plan on leaving 1 lot empty in the entire world and it is most likely the other 30x20 lot in Bridgeview (section I started in). The other lot in this area is a 40x30 lot which I plan on turning into a vegetarian restaurant. Moving away from Bridgeview, I will start building on Ridgeline Drive (mid neighbourhood). This area is going to be fully residential with regular middle class style houses (max budget of 80,000) and 1 starter home for family. I want it to be a family suburban because of the nice walkways in the back of the lots and the perfect street lining the front. Llama lagoon (lower area by lake) is going to be half residential/commercial, and rich neighbourhood.

Need help on:
1. currently I am undecided on the style of Ridgeline Drive. 
2. On Llama lagoon I also don't know what style to go for, probably mid-century.
3. In Llama Lagoon I am debating whether or not to include one regular house.

But recently, I've been sort of in a builder's block, and decided to play on my rags-to-riches legacy save, which is my main save file.

And it's been super fun.

I've always liked to play games like Stardew Valley, where it feels you always have something to do, and not enough time to do it.  And I've gotten my hands on Parenthood, Laundry Day and the Bust the Dust kit a while ago, which changed my playing style completely. 

I play with all of them active, which means my game is constantly chaotic. And I've been having a blast of a time!

The house is always dirty. Constantly. There's dust bunnies everywhere. I take my eye off of the floors for one second, and it's dirty again (just like in my real house, I'm not kidding). And don't even get me started on laundry. I grew up with clotheslines on my backyard, so I have a washing machine inside and two clotheslines outside. But it's always raining. The hamper fills up really fast, and I want to wash the clothes but when it's raining they stay too long in the clothesline... you get the idea (I had to buy a dryer, despite my mom's protests that dryers make clothing shrink).

All of that while having to take care of a young boy who has a penchant for throwing paint on the floor and making messes, a toddler girl who needs constant attention and help to do basically anything, an unexpected pregnancy (thanks Risky Woohoo) and a very easily agitated Australian Sheperd who needs constant love and attentions to prevent her from running away (again).

About 2 weeks later I grocery shopped, tried to use the card, the cashier said the card only removed $0.03 from my total. Figured it was a mistake, paid another way. I go home and check the transactions, and see literally 50 transactions all at the same exact time, for $5 each, all Google Play purchases. The cardholder and Google tell me I‚Äôm out of luck.

2005,thesims,"This game keeps disappointing me. Today I wanted to try something new, I bought a big home, (I kicked out the Landgraabs and took their home) and turned it into a giant store, I created many rooms, each one selling different type of things. I put a lot of effort into it. At first floor you can find a clothes store, and and a furniture shop. Second floor we have a plant shop and a little store selling ornaments. Top floor I put a bar, some tables and a coffee machine, because I wanted to have some sort of snack point.
I put a little playground outside, near an area where I put outside stuff for sale.
I worked many details, because I remember doing something similar with Ts2, having a lot of fun, but Ts4 sucks so bad I am conidering deleting it for good.
I hired a cashier, but he does nothing, he stands still in a spot, I asked him to interact with clients, he doesn't.
All clients stand on the same spot, they only visit the first floor, nobody ever goes up to the bar. The only shop where they seem to interact a little more is the clothing one, but they do not buy. If I ask my sim to interact with clients they will just stare at each others while time passes, until the client's needs get low and they leave because they are unconfortable.

This game keeps disappointing me. Today I wanted to try something new, I bought a big home, (I kicked out the Landgraabs and took their home) and turned it into a giant store, I created many rooms, each one selling different type of things. I put a lot of effort into it. At first floor you can find a clothes store, and and a furniture shop. Second floor we have a plant shop and a little store selling ornaments. Top floor I put a bar, some tables and a coffee machine, because I wanted to have some sort of snack point.
I put a little playground outside, near an area where I put outside stuff for sale.
I worked many details, because I remember doing something similar with Ts2, having a lot of fun, but Ts4 sucks so bad I am conidering deleting it for good.
I hired a cashier, but he does nothing, he stands still in a spot, I asked him to interact with clients, he doesn't.
All clients stand on the same spot, they only visit the first floor, nobody ever goes up to the bar. The only shop where they seem to interact a little more is the clothing one, but they do not buy. If I ask my sim to interact with clients they will just stare at each others while time passes, until the client's needs get low and they leave because they are unconfortable.
