1,thesims,"Even as someone who liked Journey to Batuu, I could see it being annoying to get that popup every time you start a new game.  And they seemed to finally tone down the lady from Eco Lifestyle asking for money all the time (I once had a rich Sim who was full Friendship meter before ever actually meeting her because of it!).  But Cottage Living...  Ugh.  Let me go a few minutes before reminding me of it!

There are sooooo many conversations I have with random Sims, many of them who don't live in Henford-on-Bagley, where just trying to have a Deep Conversation or Get to Know or many of the usual conversation subjects just give me the same popups about how I should talk to the people in Henford and offer to be their errand person.  And being told my name is being spoken around the pub, so I go there, but there's nothing to indicate what that's all about.  Why are you telling me I should go there if nothing happens?

I haven't been able to really play the last few months so this weekend is the first I've been able to load up Sims 4, and I wanted to try the new expansion.  I suppose I should have expected that with my Sim who was living there.  But I started another game with a Sim living in Del Sol Valley and even there I can't escape Sims constantly telling me to go to Henford.

Look, I get it.  You made a new pack.  You want people to play the pack and experience the new world.  Cool.  But you don't need to insert it into almost literally every bloody conversation my Sim has with another Sim no matter where I am or who I'm talking to, and telling me to go to that world just to get there and find that it's a false call is just... annoying.  Super annoying.

Bonus annoyance points to Agnes Crumplebottom, who might get me to reinstall Extreme Violence.  Oh, my Sim got asked out on a date?  This woman magically appears every time to go mess up the date.  It's a cute concept on occasion, but she's already getting on my nerves with how often she shows up whenever my Sim is anywhere outside his home trying to flirt with someone.

Plenty of interesting stuff in the pack, it seems, but so far my main observation has been that the Sims team really, really wants to keep reminding me Henford is there and I should go there.",I swear Cottage Living's popups are the most intrusive yet.

18,thesims,"If you frequently play households with 4+ sims in it, then you probably know what i mean...you're trying to focus on one sim, but the dumb AI of the others is making them get in the way, make messes, and constantly initiate unwanted conversations with the sim you're controlling. I find myself thinking ""Oh my god, just fuck off!!"" all the time.

So what if every sim (including NPCs) had an option that was like ""Take a hike...&gt;1 hour &gt;2 hours &gt;3 hours &gt;4 hours""? that would cause them to instantly disappear from the lot for that amount of time? They would experience normal need decay and just for fun, maybe a random skill gain.

I know volunteering came with one of the expansions, but it doesn't let you specify how long you want the sim to be gone. Sometimes it's just way too long for what I need.

38,thesims,"First off let me say that I'm no expert in international culture that exist in this world so if I get it wrong please explain to me nicely =).

In the Sims 4 there is a vibe that people want to feel represented in the game. whether it is ethnicity, culture, sexual orientation or gender expression. That sentiment somehow wasn't really strong in The Sims 2 (or even 3 if I recall correctly). So I would want to dive into whether Sims 2 properly represents culture in any of the expansions. Sims 3 seems pretty straight forward with World Adventures.

Most of the foreign culture would be found in Bon Voyage since they are based on international locations. Most of the time they don't claim to represent any culture, just borrow elements of it.

* Three Lakes: Definitely look North American for sure. I do suspect some elements of Scandinavian in it (Sauna and Swedish Massage)
* Takemizu Village: They play hard and fast rule in this because they are influenced by both Japanese (Zen Garden, Tea set, kimonos, the Tori Gate) and Chinese cultures (Tai Chi, Mahjong) and called it ""Far East""
* Twikii Island: Hula from Hawaiian, I'm not sure where the fire dance comes from, as well as the ancient ruins (Aztec/Maya civilization?)

They also definitely borrowed some culture in their builds and clothing. There is Korean hanbok from base game, Moroccan style builds, Mediterranean etc. 

There is also Indian, Chinese or Korean sounding names for some families (Most likely they use last names from their team)

48,thesims,"this pertains to the sims 4.

i did some general googling about this a few weeks ago when the problem first arose, and i didn't really find anything super definitive besides instructions to just ""reinstall."" wondering if anyone else is having this specific problem.

after a period of not playing for a few months, across all my saves i've been having this trouble where, after my sims are done their shifts at their respective jobs, when they come home they don't really ""come home."" their icon is still grayed out like they're at work, and i can still interact with the work-only commands (""work hard,"" ""take it easy,"" etc.), but they stand at the edge of the lot like they're done for the day. this has been happening for both the full- and part-time jobs. the only thing that sends them ""home"" is quitting their job. which is insanely frustrating, considering this is conveniently happening to sims who i actually want to play through a career. this does not affect any other sims on the lot who aren't at work.

i use three script mods (MCCC command center, cleaner; meaningful stories; and passionate romance) as well as custom content. i own cottage living, discover university, seasons, cats &amp; dogs, city living and get together, as well as parenthood and vampires. we also own nifty knitting, bowling night, and movie hangout. notably, we only recently acquired cottage living, and this started happening before we owned it.

120,thesims,"It's an advanced untamed Magic spell in Realm of Magic, because practical magic lets you repair things, clean things, and teleport, mischeif magic lets you destroy your own relationships, and untamed magic lets you rip apart the balance of the Sims in a way that you normally have to progress through several careers to do.

So... what exactly is duplicato, you might ask?

Duplicato creates a visibly and skill-wise identical copy of your sim. They will be given a kind of similar name to your current sim (for instance, I wound up with an initial character named Nadia, and her clone was named Alyssa.) Unlike the get to work cloning process, this will not flip alignments (good clones will not become evil from my experimentation). You can command this clone to cook, clean, or fight somebody, and in a few hours, they will poof themselves back into nonexistence.

But not always. 

Here are some ways I found to mess that up.

1. Create a complex clone love triangle. I had a jealous sim that made a clone then another sim made out with that clone. The clone did not go away. The clone kept showing up at festivals or whatever until I finally befriended and edited the clone and made it a part of another household, with a different outfit, missing tattoos, new scars, and a new personality. 
2. Edit the clone in any way. The moment you go into create a sim, the clone is now a permanent part of the game world and will not disappear. In some cases, this can be nice. One of my sims died and I couldn't get them to come back from being a ghost (dedeathify and ambrosia wouldn't work) so I just gave up, deleted the sim, and started a new life as their clone.
3. Inviting them to a social event. For example, putting them in a club, or calling them to join a party (even as a caterer). This makes the sim real and permanent, and they won't disappear.
4. Adding them to your household via cheats or via conversation. This will obviously make them a permanent part of the household.
5. If a sim you do not control casts duplicato, it seems as if the associated clone just exists now. I had a club where one of the positive activities was spellcasting, and a NPC sim cast duplicato, creating a permanent clone that just appeared at festivals some times. 

So what does a clone do?

They have all the skills and magic levels of the original sim, but none of the relationships, money, or inventory. My sim that died had the ancient bloodline trait. When I took control of her disowned clone, she also had ancient bloodline, and her magic skills were where they were when I created the clone.

They have traits and university degrees of the original sim. This means that you can start a job at career level 7 as if you had a degree, even though the clone does not have a degree itself.

If you have a full household of 8 sims, you invite over 8 more, and you attempt to get all of the above to cast duplicato, you can almost definitely break the game. 

Clones register as siblings of the caster. This means that you can have a really messed up family tree if you create enough permanent clones of a character. Two parents can give birth to one baby, and when that baby reaches teenage to adulthood, they can perform magical mitosis and turn into infinite versions of themselves (note that you need to wait a while between duplicato uses).

My personal recommendation:

Some people try to create the ""super sim"", with perfect skills and all the traits. It takes forever. If you want a whole household of these, you can have the super sim mentor all of them, or you can just have the super sim become a spellcaster long enough to get far enough in the untamed magic tree to create other sims. Add them to the household and edit them to be whatever name, appearance, age, and personality you want, and you have an entire household.

Clones act as save states for sims too, if you, like me, are prone to having sims die in stupid ways. They just walk around and exist, and if your sim dies, you can always just possess the clone and make them the new protagonist of whatever messed up story you're creating. 

Or you can make your clone cook, clean, beat the crap out of your neighbors, and then disappear. That's chill too.",A general guide to duplicato

148,thesims,"Hi!

We've had all our share of frustration in TS4 with people just entering our Sims' residence and just. Refusing. To. Leave. But a few days ago I had someone that I could not get rid of no matter what I tried, to the point where I cheated to give myself enough money to move to a house.

I was living in an apartment from the City Living town as a aspiring pro gamer, and if that makes any difference, I even had the ""Private dwelling"" trait on it. 

Everything was cool until one day, this random Sim just comes in my apartment. He starts using my computer, he starts eating my food, he walks on me when I'm in the bathroom, he SLEEPS IN MY FREAKING BED, and his very presence made my sleep and time at work super long because he was an active Sim in my lot so I could not get the uber speed. I was also pissed because my Sim is a loner and his presence was making her tense, when he wasn't getting her embarrassed from entering in the bathroom when she was taking a bath.

The option to ""Send home"" never showed up in the menu (so random how it's not always there but it always shows up eventually, not for THIS GUY though). 

I also never had the ""Ask to leave"" dialogue option.

I started using mean interaction towards him, including ""Go away"", I even fought him and won, but he still stayed.

He was there for several days and never had the ""Oopsie, gotta leave, it's late"" prompt.

He eventually walked out of my apartment (either autonomously or because I lured him by moving there as I talked to him, can't remember) so I immediately locked my door to everyone but my Sim and disabled solicitors, friends, visitors, EVERYTHING, but that motherF-er just WALTZED BACK IN REGARDLESS and started using my stuff as though he lived there. HELLO. YOU DON'T LEAVE HERE. GET OUT.

I looked online for ways to get rid of him, through the console or otherwise, but no luck. At my wit's ends, I used the motherlode cheat (which pissed me off because I didn't want to money cheat in that game) and moved out to a house in Sulani. 

Has this happened to anyone else? Is there a way to get rid of such a random NPC invading my home aside from moving out??? I was super frustrated because I loved her apartment :(",Can't get rid of a NPC???

what do you actually like about this trait and what are some of the challenges of having it equipped on a sim?

for example, I really like the lazy trait and always choose to interpret it as more of a ‚Äúhomebody‚Äù trait. The sim likes to be at home, cozied up, hanging out, not too concerned with their professional performance. One of the benefits of this trait is that the lazy nap is lowkey OP and gets energy up super fast. I also think it‚Äôs cute that lazies can fall asleep in chairs. One of the major downsides is that they get tense about doing household chores + cleaning. They also complain about handiness + fitness which are some of my favorite skills to build :‚Äô) I find I usually couple lazy with sims who are family-oriented, extroverted, or trying to escape the ‚Äúrat race‚Äù as part of their storyline.

164,thesims,"I noticed something that's very interesting to me in the franchise's lore. 

So starting with The Sims 1, there were alien abductions that were treated with the sims crying and then treating the abducted sim like normal when they come back, as if they know exactly what the abductions entail. Then the babies with an alien skintone are treated like normal babies.

In The Sims 2 there is no in-game mechanics that make the aliens any different than regular sims but in the game's lore it's very prominent that there's a lot of tensions between the aliens and the people. The abductions are known about, with how your friends can greet you with ""hey, have you been abducted by aliens?"" on the phone and have wants/fears of it happening. The abducted sims are horrified of what this means and there's a lot of scientists studying the subject, meaning they don't know as much about aliens yet.

In TS3 there isn't a single alien living on Earth but they do come by to inspect it. The sims don't treat them any different (unless there was some moodlet I don't remember). The aliens can become test subject and can't get plastic surgery, so we can say that the sims don't know a lot about them. The effects of abduction are not known either, since pregnant males think it's abnormal weight gain until they give birth.

Then in The Sims 4 aliens need to put on human disguises and wipe the memories of sims who see them in their alien form. The sims who do then have a crisis about aliens actually being real.

Now I know that realistically this is mostly attributed to the game developers putting more thought into this overtime but it's still interesting what it means for the game's lore.",The decrease in normalcy of aliens as the games went all

189,thesims,"So I'm an older Simmer, I started with the first edition and I've played each of them, but definitely spent the most amount of time with 1 and 2. I bought Sims 4 years ago and tried it and didn't really like it, but couldn't figure out why, and stopped playing. A few months ago for various reasons I realized I wanted to play again. I even bought a newer laptop to play. But I am just so confused by the limited gameplay. 

I'm in Willow Creek, and I can't walk anywhere without ""driving"". In Sims 3 weren't we able to walk around the map freely? Also, there are so few activities in the town. Literally only 4 lots where I can meet people? And they have almost nothing inside those lots. Is Willow Creek just a really bad world? 

The camera sucks, but I read a Sims expert recommending I switch to the Sims 3 camera, so I'm going to do that.  I also saw online that experts recommend moving people into all the empty homes so I'm going to do that too, once I figure out how to do it (the entire downloading things from the internet to add to the game is new to me - I tried moving someone in but when I went back to the game the house was still uninhabited). Are there any other tips I should try?

If I buy literally all the expansion packs and stuff, will the game actually feel ""full""? I liked watching Kelsey's 100 Baby Challenge with all the expansion packs but it was clearly sponsored by EA to make the game look good, and it didn't really involve any exploration. I only have City Living, but the layout is so strange (again, with the map requiring driving to every single lot). I feel so mad because I procrastinated buying the expansion packs I want and now they're back up to $40 (they were all $20 each last week). But if that's what it takes, I'm prepared to do it. At this point though I'm not willing to throw good money after bad.",Will I ever truly be happy?

Easy right?

Apparently not. 

She arrived at the clinic at around 9 am sim time, first client arrived, she began visiting the cat, the cat would jump on the table, then when she is about to visit him the table would slide down and the cat would walk away. It's okay, it has happened other times, no biggie, I asked to restart the visit, same thing happened, asked again, cat got off again, and again, and again and I lost count of how many times it happened.
I debugged her, it happened again, I debugged the cat, it happened again, I debugged the table.
Now the cat is on the table, she is standing beside it with her arms open  not doing anything, debugging does not work anymore. It is 14:30 simtime, she accomplished nothing, customers are lining up and getting angry, clinic's reputation is going down.

&amp;#x200B;

* *How to get Graphics Rules Maker to work:*

Simply run it as administrator manually, and when it opens, go to the Preview for the first file which should be GraphicsRules.sgr Preview. Hit Save As, and let it save. For the second, go to VideoCards.sgr Preview and hit Save As, and let it save. The location of this should be roughly: `Program Files (x86)\Mr DJ\The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection\The Sims 2 Mansion and Garden Stuff\TSData\Res\Config`

&amp;#x200B;

* *How to get 4 GB Patch to work:*

Simply also run this as an administrator manually, and make sure you are patching the file: `Program Files (x86)\Mr DJ\The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection\The Sims 2 Mansion and Garden Stuff\TSBin\Sims2EP9.exe`

As an addendum, if it still does not work or you are using a shortcut, use the 4 GB patcher in Administrator on the shortcut as well if you still experience pink flashing. This should fix it.

I remember when The Sims 2 came out, I got heavy into CC and it started to break my game. I lost many save files back then. 

I didn't care for The Sims 3 but I'm in full speed ahead with The Sims 4 and I am so far separated from the horror of CC in The Sims 2 that I cannot fathom the obsession with mods and CC today.

What I'm trying to say is...

Please, someone:

1) Explain the wonderful world of mods and CC 

2) Is it just as broken as it was back then? (I've seen streamers lose their whole games because of CC in the past few years. One streamer can't play The Sims 4 University at all )

""Mods Disabled after update. Game restart required."" it says like always. So I re-enable mods and restart my game.

Except when I reopen it, the same pop up appears, mods are disabled yet again. So naive little me presumes it was a glitch, enables mods and once more, restarts the game.

But this happens again, and again, and (you guessed it again). I restart my computer, it still doesn't fix the in-game toggle that refuses to be turned on.

This has been going on for a few days so I contact EA help. I explain the issue and how it's something in game that has gone wrong as I only use very common and popular mods (SoL, MCCC, UI cheats). I am then told to just ""not use mods"". I am fuming at the impertinence of this answer and after explaining that it isn't due to the mods and is due to the game and being told once again to just not use mods, I passive aggressively tell the employee to have a nice day and I leave the chat.

There are so many common houseplants that you'd have trouble not finding at most plant nurseries or big box store greenhouses that just aren't included.

449,thesims,"So I have a bit of a conundrum. I'm making a sort of 'goth' playlist using solely simlish songs (if possible). I'm an advocate fan of goth music irl, and I love making goth sims in-game.

That being said, I have long enjoyed the music in Sims games, even if they don't have 'understandable' lyrics. Anyway, aside from the obvious songs 
-- Spooky station from Sims 4, Industrial station from the console versions of Sims 2, Central Station music from Urbz, Darkwave station in Sims 3 -- 
it's been difficult finding songs that would be appropriate or considered 'goth'.

I've been looking into other genres within the games, such as pop, electronica/techno, etc., and while I have found some really good ones that do fit, most obviously don't. I do want to upload this simlish goth playlist somewhere, as I am comprising it of mp3 files, but even though I have over 40 songs now, it still doesn't feel complete.

I think any of the games, from spin-offs to different versions of one game in the franchise or another, would have a lot of potential. They're at least worth combing the files for. I just don't have all the games to effectively do such a thing.

If anyone has any suggestions or links to blogs, YouTube, etc. involving any game in the series, old or new, please feel free to give them. Like I said, I'm planning on uploading the files and allowing the project to be obtained by other fans of the Sims games, so I do want it to be as comprehensive as possible.

474,thesims,,"I tried building a bar in TS4, first community lot build"
475,thesims,"I don't have every DLC pack but I have a few, so here's all the aspirations from all the DLC I have, divided into categories of usefulness.

**Absolutely worth the effort**

Bodybuilder: Fast, easy accomplishments that let your sim just hover around old age for like another entire generation. Very strong.

Bestselling author: This one lets you cheat death as many times as you like. Quite good, quite powerful.

Super parent: If you already have a bunch of kids living in a house, why not turn their parent into superman? Great to have an incredibly skilled old fart.

Big Happy family: That but now the kids gain skills faster to give to their parent faster. Especially good if the parent is immortal, like they're a ghost or a vampire or something.

Master chef: You can just make food for later, leave it on the counter, and eat it whenever. It never goes bad. This is fantastic.

Master Mixologist: There are some things you can make that greatly increase skill gain, which is pretty good. Combine it with master chef and you can make a ton of these and leave them out and they won't go bad.

Renaissance Sim: Better for legacy playthroughs, but it can be good to be able to send your knowledge forward a few generations.

Computer Whiz: Research binge is the main ""worth it"" thing, if you want to just raise a lot of skills and don't care what order.

Beach Life: Tense is an annoying emotion that prevents a lot of productive actions and now you just never get it again. This aspiration is really easy to get too.

Freelance botanist: For some reason it makes sims fireproof. Not sure why, but that is what it does. They can't die in fires. Nobody really expects a sim to die in a fire but sometimes it happens, unless they get really into botany.

Eco innovator: You control a person's level of fame or infamy. Very strong, very funny.

Joke star: Death by laughter is a thing in the sims 4. I'll let that speak for itself.

Grilled Cheese: More for the experience than the results, but being able to spontaneously create a grilled cheese sandwich with one's will is hilarious. With master chef, you can create a house full of grilled cheese that will never expire. Truly the best possible outcome.

**Worth it if you're already using the thing it's about**

Friend of the animals: Admittedly, if ageing is off, this is worthless, because your pet will be perfectly trained by the time you're finished anyways, but if ageing is on, it's nice because animals don't live as long so you might as well be able to train up the next one faster.

Painter extraordinaire: You're already max level in painting more than likely when this is done, but you might as well get perfect emotional paintings every time. More money from an already decently fast and financially viable activity.

Super parent: Friend of the animals but for kids. Only good if you plan on having more after the first set is finished.

Serial Romantic: If you're seducing that many sims, this is an absolute game changer. Now you can woohoo with another one, get caught, and nobody cares.

Soulmate: These interactions provide nice happy moodlets, and if you're already in the market for some monogamy, might as well make it work for you. This might pair with Serial Romantic to allow for multiple spouses but I'm not sure.

Country Caretaker: Buffs a lot of stuff specific to farming in Henford-On-Bagley, but if you're doing that, this is awesome.

The curator: If you're gathering a bunch of crap anyways, might as well sell it for more. Pairs very well with the scientist career.

Friend of the world: Nice way to maintain a big list of friends, otherwise not that important.

Galactic Privateer: Kleptomania with no consequences can be funny.

Calming aura: It's mostly for the visuals but the visuals are fun.

Self-Care specialist: You're already doing this, might as well get a raise.

**If you have it, you no longer need it.**

Survival Instinct: To do this, you've basically finished Mt. Korembi. There's no reason to get this anymore.

Master actor/actress: The stuff you have to do to get this make this worthless. You've already gotten gold in several different gigs and won an award.

Fabulously wealthy: Now you... get more money. Since you didn't have money before.

Mansion Baron: Now you can... build a bigger house. Because you didn't have a big house before.

Nerd Brain: You can fix everything pretty quickly with even very low handiness

Spellcraft and Sorcery: At this point, you can probably just discharge magic buildup.

World Famous Celebrity: The real fun part here is laying down a star. Aside from that, it's not altogether that necessary. When you're really famous, your fame goes up from literally standing around in public.

Leader of the pack: Your club is probably already quite good by this point.

Party animal: You've already thrown really good parties by this point.

Good Vampire: first off it's way less interesting than playing an evil vampire, and second, if you have enough positive relationships, they'll let you drink from them regardless.

**Something else is easier and better than this**

Piper: There are so many ways to influence a sim's mood, this doesn't really matter.

Public enemy: Funny for a second but it's not hard to make a sim feel a negative emotion.

Vampire family: Outclassed by Master Vampire

Academic: A lot of work to get a free source of income. Honestly, the degree is more important than the aspiration.

Mt. Korembi Sightseer: The easier socialization is okay, but cheaper stall food can be done with decent charisma, and it's not that expensive anyways. Only applies to two areas in the entire game.

City Native: Free discounts are faster than the Mt. Korembi one, but there's nothing else there for you.

Purveyor of Potions: There's a selectable spellcasting perk that does exactly what this does.

Angling Ace: There are easier ways to reduce bad moodlets, but this is fine if you want a way to make some money while removing all negative moodlets.

Clear perspective: Beach life does this by default.

**Not really noticeable enough**

Master maker: Crafting isn't that expensive. This makes it somewhat cheaper, but it doesn't matter that much for a sim that's already crazy good at it.

Tormenter: You can already sabotage most things with a handiness skill, so this isn't super significant.

Master Vampire: The commands aren't even that good when you can just hire a maid, or get Bonehilda for free with the right DLC.

Strangerville Mystery: The goodie bags they give you aren't very good. Food and future cubes and sometimes literal dirt. The getting is better than the having.

Hope vs Order: Only applicable in the Star Wars world. The campaign itself matters more than this.",A deep look at how useful every Aspiration is

Let me know if you have any doubts :)

&amp;#x200B;

* You start as a **young adult** \- *with zero money* \- who has just moved to San Myshuno, but you get **the worst possible apartment**  (the one with the balcony and lot's of rats and bugs and plumbing  issues). You are allowed to have furniture, but you have to make the  place look old and disgusting (before starting the challenge you can  build as you wish). You can't have nice appliances.
* You'll choose the **Super Parent** aspiration.
* You are allowed to work only as a barista, or as a fast food/retail employee.
* Then  you meet someone and have a kid. You cannot get married to that person  and you'll have none to minor contact with them. In my game, my kid has a  super absent father.
* You  and your kid have to live under constant stress. You'll feel always  tense, so sometimes you won't be able to perform very important tasks.  Your kid will feel so tense with all the rats and smelly environment  that they won't do their homework. Bad grades, sleep deprivement, barely  enough food. Meanwhile you'll **save all the money you can**, promising yourself it's going to go to your kid's college tuition.

In my game, my kid learned how to cross-stitch and knit and he helps his mom make extra money.

* You have to be promoted on your job and earn raises. Then you can save some money, 'cause when your kid becomes a teen, **you'll move to a better apartment**,  without those freaking rats, so your kid can study and reach A grades.  Your kid will not be able to enroll at any college, but *they'll get a slightly better job* (my kid is turning out to love comedy, so he's going to be a comedian). **Their job will depend on their skills and personality** (you have to randomize the traits every time your kid grows up).
* When  your kid becomes an young adult, they'll decide to make things right  and be different from their father. So they will get married, all that  jazz, and have at least one child. **And this child has to go to college**.
* You'll  upgrade the apartment gradually whenever you want and are able to. By  the third generation, when your child is an adult, you can move to a  better apartment. And so on.
* Besides getting to the 10th generation, you objective is to end up in a **penthouse** with one of **the best jobs available**. So you do whatever it takes to improve your family life, your children's education and your pay grade.
* Just one more thing: **you have to completely accomplish every aspiration**. The aspirations are going to be chosen based on your Sims' personalities and those personalities need to be randomized.

The rest is up to your imagination.",From Rats to Penthouse: my new legacy challenge!

#**Introduction for Newcomers**

Every two weeks the challenge will change, We‚Äôll design a different house or interior of a room and we might even sneak a few Create-A-Sims in to break it up a little.

#**Bi-Weekly Build Challenge, Week 117: A-Contemporary A-Frame Cabins!* 

The A-frame, in its purest sense, is a house shaped like an equilateral triangle. Its distinctive peak is formed by rafters or trusses that are joined at the top and bolted to plates or floor joists down below. Occasionally short on space, A frames are forever rooted in boundless ingenuity. They are highly adaptable structures that allow for boundless creative collaboration between architects, designers and the residents themselves. Really, the roof‚Äôs the limit. And that‚Äôs it: A-frames meet the earth on rubble or cinderblock walls, concrete or wood columns, but their essential nature is to float slightly above their environment, a viewing platform for an expanse of nature. 


Residential &amp; vacation properties ONLY. Must be fully functional. (TIP: Consider using cheats to unlock debug/hidden items and to place objects more freely!)

***NOTE: Challenges are open for TWO weeks!***

666,thesims,"Hi everyone, Carl's Sim Guides here. I've been working on a mod to address what I see as a problem in Sims 4: its difficulty. No, a Sims game shouldn't be hard, but past games were a bit more tough to manage. Especially time and relationships. It doesn't yet add tons of depth, but it will make certain aspects of the game more challenging.

First, **Career Performance** is reduced by a tad, but losses to career performance are increased substantially. It's rare to lose a lot of performance, but skipping a day of work will really set you back. Better off making it a half day. It's just realistic. People get sick and lose their jobs, but at least in the Sims your past performance is measured.

Second, **Emotion.** Many moodlets in the game lack the punch to go through the multitude of happy bonuses that exist. Sometimes, something should actually make your Sim angry or sad and this should slow you down a bit and make relationships difficult. For experienced players, this can be a joke. All negative moodlets with +1-3 are doubled in strength and duration. Those that have long durations, in order to account for the game considering these ""big events"" are tripled duration but if strong enough may only have a couple points added.

Third, **Finances** \- bills are doubled, primarily property taxes. In addition, **incomes are halved** just to make the build catalog a bit more sane on many items. That $675 solar panel will now effectively cost you $1350 so it'll be hard to defeat the game's Eco system right away in a save. Doubling bills and halving finances are not the same thing and not equivalent. You make income all week and therefore can afford the extra bills. Does this scale well with mansions? Well, I don't care much because by the time I'm that rich the game is often over for me.

Finally **Relationships** \- understanding of the relationships system will be needed, as if you spam socials without regard for the conversation tone, mood of yourself and the other Sim, you can dig yourself a hole due to increased losses to relationship gains. In addtion, it will take about 2x as long to build a friendship or romance with another Sim. 

[Here is a link to my mod](https://www.patreon.com/posts/update-1-03-sims-58183239), available to all on Patreon. 

I'm working hard on it, can use feedback and playtesters. I plan to put my all into this one thing as I've learned Python and some XML so I can actually implement my ideas. Not all decisions are final and I hope to address depth much more in the future. I recognize this mod is not a magic bullet.",Carl's The Sims 4 Difficulty Mod.

690,thesims,"Hey there. I want to play Sims 3 (Steam version) on a laptop, but I keep encountering this ""Device 0 cannot run this title"" error and the game won't load, because it doesn't recognise my GPU. Here's what I've tried so far:  


1) Updated .sgr files to include both integrated and discrete GPUs

2) Disabled one of the two GPUs and tried to run the game

3) Changed various settings in Nvidia Control Panel (VSync, framerate limit, etc)

4) Updated drivers for both of my GPUs

Nothing helped. I'm convinced the problem lies in the fact that I have 2 GPUs, because I was able to play TS3 on my previous PC that had GTX 1060 and no integrated graphics (without even changing .sgr files), but on RTX 2060 it won't even load. I don't think the game cares whether it's 1060 or 2060, because both are too new for it. 

What can I do to solve this? At this point I'm ready to try everything, including emulators for older games (if there are any) or even cloud gaming services.","Device 0 cannot run this title, Sims 3"

781,thesims,"Hello!  


I have been a big fan of The Sims my whole life. The Sims 2 was the best and I had a super hard time going over to TS4 (I never really tried TS3 because I was so angry at it and hated it without really giving it a chance..) but eventually I started to love TS4 aswell. Even tho the bugs that I encounter everytime I play it is super annoying and was never a problem TS2. However very glad that it is possible to actually change these in updates etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway, I went down on memory lane and I remembered some stuff I really missed from TS2:   
\- Being able to adopt a child that was taken by child services with another family  
\- Could be your own chef in your resturant (I think this was a thing, right?)   


Probably more of stuff I miss, but it is such a long time since I played it I barely remember! What do you miss?",What do you miss in The Sims 4 that was in The Sims 2?

I'm basically just wondering what things in The Sims can trigger restricted mode for a video as I'd like to edit those things out before posting to Youtube. I don't swear much in my videos, just words like damn, shit, hell, etc. and not very often at all. I've heard that ""depictions of woohoo"" can cause restricted mode so for those of you who post to Youtube, do you edit out woohoo? Also what about the simlish radio stations, are those often flagged by copyright? Just kinda looking for some general advice as I'm new to this.

My teen sim is currently grounded (he was on a late night date with his boyfriend, come on, let the high school sweethearts be sweethearts!!). As we all know, the grounding system in TS3 is‚Ä¶ extreme to say the least. I think we‚Äôve all experienced a sim literally not being able to go to school because they‚Äôre grounded‚Ä¶

Well I just saw this system take itself to a new height. The teen got an interaction, ‚Äúinspect mysterious anomaly‚Äù or something like that with a UFO icon. OH NO. He‚Äôs gonna get abducted?! But also cool. I‚Äôve rarely seen sims in TS3 get abducted so I was kinda excited. But then the action CANCELS (which you can‚Äôt do on your own normally) and I get a pop up from his mom saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so buster, you‚Äôre grounded!!‚Äù

I CAN‚ÄôT. So basically‚Ä¶ being grounded rules all and my sim literally got saved(?) from abduction because he is not allowed to even step foot outside in the yard. The aliens looked down upon him and said ‚Äúoh no, he is grounded, mission failed, we‚Äôll get him next time. We‚Äôre not messing with the fury of a mother!!‚Äù Kinda sad as I kinda wanted to see the abduction but overall hilarious!",Sims 3 grounding system strikes again‚Ä¶

800,thesims,"As the title reads, I am currently making my very first downloadable save file. 

Reason: To start off I wanted to just focus on filling up Newcrest with houses but no families. I want to just have builds so the players can add the families they wish or just use newcrest as a way to quickly move to a house without looking for it on the gallery or building it themselves.

Currently: I started in the upper section of newcrest called Bridgeview where there are 5 lots, this is the modern/eco friendly area. On a 20x15 lot by the canal, I have a small 1 bedroom house that is a starter home for a 1 or maybe 2 sims. On the other 20x15 lot, I have a park with yoga mats and a place to eat and public toilets. On a 30x20 lot by the intersection I am currently building a 2 bedroom 2-storey modern house, with garage, pool, solar panels, a very expensive eco house. 

Future plans: on the section I am currently building I have 2 lots left, I plan on leaving 1 lot empty in the entire world and it is most likely the other 30x20 lot in Bridgeview (section I started in). The other lot in this area is a 40x30 lot which I plan on turning into a vegetarian restaurant. Moving away from Bridgeview, I will start building on Ridgeline Drive (mid neighbourhood). This area is going to be fully residential with regular middle class style houses (max budget of 80,000) and 1 starter home for family. I want it to be a family suburban because of the nice walkways in the back of the lots and the perfect street lining the front. Llama lagoon (lower area by lake) is going to be half residential/commercial, and rich neighbourhood.

Need help on:
1. currently I am undecided on the style of Ridgeline Drive. 
2. On Llama lagoon I also don't know what style to go for, probably mid-century.
3. In Llama Lagoon I am debating whether or not to include one regular house.
4. What community lots do I add to llama lagoon? I want 2 commercial lots that fit well into this rich style of neighbourhood. 
5. Best way to make my save file downloadable for players and where to put it up.

But recently, I've been sort of in a builder's block, and decided to play on my rags-to-riches legacy save, which is my main save file.

And it's been super fun.

I've always liked to play games like Stardew Valley, where it feels you always have something to do, and not enough time to do it.  And I've gotten my hands on Parenthood, Laundry Day and the Bust the Dust kit a while ago, which changed my playing style completely. 

I play with all of them active, which means my game is constantly chaotic. And I've been having a blast of a time!

The house is always dirty. Constantly. There's dust bunnies everywhere. I take my eye off of the floors for one second, and it's dirty again (just like in my real house, I'm not kidding). And don't even get me started on laundry. I grew up with clotheslines on my backyard, so I have a washing machine inside and two clotheslines outside. But it's always raining. The hamper fills up really fast, and I want to wash the clothes but when it's raining they stay too long in the clothesline... you get the idea (I had to buy a dryer, despite my mom's protests that dryers make clothing shrink).

All of that while having to take care of a young boy who has a penchant for throwing paint on the floor and making messes, a toddler girl who needs constant attention and help to do basically anything, an unexpected pregnancy (thanks Risky Woohoo) and a very easily agitated Australian Sheperd who needs constant love and attentions to prevent her from running away (again).

I don't think I've had that much fun playing in a long time! I don't even have that much CC and mods in my game anymore, and I didn't really think The Sims 4 could be this fun!

Today I wanted to try something new, I bought a big home, (I kicked out the Landgraabs and took their home) and turned it into a giant store, I created many rooms, each one selling different type of things. I put a lot of effort into it. At first floor you can find a clothes store, and and a furniture shop. Second floor we have a plant shop and a little store selling ornaments. Top floor I put a bar, some tables and a coffee machine, because I wanted to have some sort of snack point.
I put a little playground outside, near an area where I put outside stuff for sale.
I worked many details, because I remember doing something similar with Ts2, having a lot of fun, but Ts4 sucks so bad I am conidering deleting it for good.
I hired a cashier, but he does nothing, he stands still in a spot, I asked him to interact with clients, he doesn't.
All clients stand on the same spot, they only visit the first floor, nobody ever goes up to the bar. The only shop where they seem to interact a little more is the clothing one, but they do not buy. If I ask my sim to interact with clients they will just stare at each others while time passes, until the client's needs get low and they leave because they are unconfortable. Whenever someone is actually buying something she will do the same, and 2 out of 3 buying costumers will just leave without buying.
I am actually sad, why is this game so bad? Ts2 had similar features and it worked so well, I had so much fun with shops, they were my favourite things, Ts4 is supposed to be the improved version of the other games, but is the worst, even the sims 1 was better, at least you did not have great expectations with it.",Why is Ts4 so hard to enjoy?
